### I see a gap

*When someone says "brain training", we think of learning.*

*When someone says "hygiene" we think of tooth-brushing.*

But that is really only like a specific type of strength training or diet.
How effective would a weight-lifing, healthy-eating boxer be who skipped cardio?

The landscape of mental health tools tend toward narrow and deep profiles, typically based on reactive analysis and care.

**DBLB is about proactive mental hygiene; "tending the garden" before it is full of dead plants and weeds.**
